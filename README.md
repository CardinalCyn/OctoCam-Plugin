# OctoPrint-Octocam

**Description:** Plugin to provide a stream/snapshot url and stream as an alternative to YawCam.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/CardinalCyn/OctoPrint-Octocam/archive/master.zip

## Configuration

**TODO:** Find OctoCam in the settings of the plugins section. Click the pull cameras, and use the dropdown to select the desired camera you'd like to get a feed for.
Enter your desired width and height for the stream, and then click pull feed to get the stream and snapshot urls. You can then copy and paste these urls into the webcams/
timelapses section of Octoprint. It might take a couple of seconds for Octoprint to be able to view the stream.
